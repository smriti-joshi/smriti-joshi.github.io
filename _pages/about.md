I am a doctoral student at <a href = "https://www.bcn-aim.org/"><b>BCN-AIM</b></a> laboratory in Universitat de Barcelona, under the supervision of Oliver Diaz Montesdeoca and Karim Lekadir. My research is supported by <a href = "https://radioval.eu/"><b>RadioVal</b></a>, a European project on clinical validation of radiomics based methods for evaluating response of breast cancer to NAC. My current work focuses on development and evaluation of fair and robust methods for breast cancer treatment planning. 

I graduated with MSc.(Hons) in Image processing and Computer Vision, jointly coordinated by  the Autonomous University of Madrid (Spain), University of Bordeaux (France), and Pázmány Péter Catholic University (Hungary) under the Erasmus Mundus programme. My master thesis was under the joint supervision of Dr. Hanspeter Pfister (<a href = "https://vcg.seas.harvard.edu/"><b>VCG Harvard, USA</b></a>) and Dr. Pascal Desbarats (<a href = "https://www.labri.fr/"><b>LaBRI, Bordeaux, France</b></a>) on connectomics segmentation. Parallely, I worked with Dr. Sergio Escalera (<a href = "http://www.cvc.uab.es/"><b>CVC, Barcelona, Spain</b></a>) and Karim Lekadir (BCN-AIM, Barcelona, Spain) for domain adaptation in Brain MRI.

I am a member of <a href="https://conferences.miccai.org/2024/en/"><b>MICCAI 2024</b></a> Sponsorship Committee. I am also an active member of <a href = "https://africai.org/"><b>AFRICAI</b></a>: A network to promote AI for medical applications in the African continent. In 2022, I was a reviewer for IEEE Transactions in Medical Imaging and ECCV Workshop.
